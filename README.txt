This plugin retrieves group information from the MyClub member administration platform (https://member.myclub.se) and generates pages for groups defined in the platform.

== Description ==

The MyClub Groups plugin is designed to retrieve group information from the MyClub member administration platform. It automatically generates WordPress pages for each group, making it easy to manage and display organized data for all groups in your club. The plugin is dependent on you having an account and subscription to the MyClub member administration platform (https://member.myclub.se). Without a subscription and an API key to the MyClub member administration platform, the plugin will not work. For terms of usage please see https://www.myclub.se/customeragreement

The plugin automatically retrieves group information from the MyClub member administration platform and creates pages for all groups defined in your WordPress settings in MyClub. You can also use both Gutenberg blocks and shortcodes for adding data on other pages.

For the calendar views the plugin uses the open source version of the FullCalendar (v.6.1.11) plugin, which can be seen here: https://fullcalendar.io/. All source to the plugin is available here: https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar. No data is being sent to the FullCalendar plugin website.
