Retrieves group information from the MyClub member administration platform. Generates pages for groups defined in the MyClub platform.

== Description ==

This plugin is intended for associations and organizations that use the MyClub membership system and need to fetch data to display on their website. Examples of such data include calendars, news, and groups.

Please ensure that your server is running on PHP 7.4 or higher and your WordPress version is at least 6.4 to utilize this plugin fully.

=== Components ===
The components fetch objects from MyClub and store them in WordPress. These objects are retrieved continuously and automatically, but not in real time. You can choose to display the various components in different places on your website. The available components are:
* News
* Calendar
* Upcoming Activities
* Groups
* Group Members
* Group Menu

See the blocks below for more information.

Within MyClub, you configure which groups and in what order they should be displayed for the plugin. The plugin can then create a menu so visitors can navigate between the association's groups.

=== Appearance ===
All components are minimally designed to make them easier to customize and fit your websiteâ€™s design. All headers, tables, images, and similar items have their own CSS classes, allowing you to style them according to your preferences.

== Dependencies ==

The plugin has no external plugin dependencies. All requirements are bundled in the plugin itself. However we are using the following opensource library (which is included in the plugin):
* FullCalendar (v5.11.5), which can be seen [here](https://fullcalendar.io/). All source to the plugin is available [here](https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar). No data is being sent to the FullCalendar plugin website.

== Installation ==

To fetch data from MyClub, you must first install this plugin:
1. Login to your WordPress Dashboard
2. Go to Plugins -> Add New
3. Search for MyClub groups plugin
4. Install the MyClub groups plugin
5. Activate it.
6. Add your API key to the plugin settings.

You can generate an API key within MyClub under Productions and prices in MyClub. Please note that once the key is generated, you need to save it immediately and paste it into the newly installed plugin.

Once the plugin is installed with the API key, you can begin using it. The plugin consists of various components that can be added to any page via either Gutenberg blocks, Shortcodes, or group-specific pages that are designed using a template and then applied to all groups. For example, you can place a calendar at the top and news below it. This setup will look the same across all group pages, but the plugin dynamically determines which calendar to display based on the group currently being viewed.
